          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>I‚Äôm a <span class="tooltip">true-blue<span class="tooltiptext">Born and raised in Australia</span></span> Aussie üá¶üá∫ currently living in California‚Äôs beautiful Bay Area, enjoying good coffee
            ‚òï local wildlife üêø and aimless walks üëüÔ∏è. I‚Äôm absolutely <span class="tooltip">chuffed<span class="tooltiptext">Excited, Keen, Pleased</span></span>
            to have the chance to apply my burgeoning public health knowledge and passion here in the United States!<br><br>

            I chose to study Public Health because I knew I wanted a career that supports and uplifts communities that
            need it most, especially in the healthcare space. It‚Äôs a very clich√© sentiment, but I‚Äôve always felt a strong
            purpose in life to help and serve others.<br><br>

            Before moving to<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> the USA, I worked at <a href="https://kinela.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinela</a>, a health start-up in Sydney where we
            focused on serving and empowering Australians living with a disability.
            I worked across a number of areas at the company including customer service, customer experience and growth. 
            Within the customer service team I managed communication with Kinela members, service providers, allied health professionals, and government agencies. 
            I enjoyed creating engaging customer-facing resources along with continually building out internal resources and scripting in this role.<br>
            
            My transition to the growth team saw me lead a collaborative project aimed at improving the workflow process for renewals along with creating more thoughtful customer marketing journeys. 
            This cross-team collaborative effort allowed us to exceed retention targets by 40%, reduced overall errors, and most importantly the end-to-end customer experience at this touch-point was greatly enhanced.¬†
            <br><br>

            I‚Äôm looking to grow in a career that contributes to the development, implementation, and maintenance of
            effective and sustainable interventions that improve health outcomes, especially for vulnerable or underserved
            communities. If you happen to have a role that might be a good fit, please let me know on my <a
