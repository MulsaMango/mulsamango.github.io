        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôm a <span class="tooltip">true-blue<span class="tooltiptext">Born and raised in Australia</span></span> Aussie üá¶üá∫ currently living in California‚Äôs beautiful Bay Area, enjoying good coffee
          ‚òï local wildlife üêø and aimless walks üëüÔ∏è. I‚Äôm absolutely <span class="tooltip">chuffed<span class="tooltiptext">Excited, Keen, Pleased</span></span>
          to have the chance to apply my burgeoning public health knowledge and passion here in the United States.<br><br>

          I chose to study Public Health because I knew I wanted a career that supports and uplifts communities that
          need it most, especially in the healthcare space. It‚Äôs a very clich√© sentiment, but I‚Äôve always felt a strong
          purpose in life to help and serve others.<br><br>

          Before moving to<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> the USA, I worked at <a href="https://kinela.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinela</a>, a small health start-up in Sydney where we
          focused on serving Australians living with a disability, who are often overrepresented in poorer health
          outcomes. I worked on a number of areas within the company starting in customer service, where I directly
          supported our customers with queries, issue resolution, and basic health coaching every single day! I later
          moved to a renewals officer role, where I focused on making sure our existing customers could continue making
          best use of our services, and even optimised the tracking of renewal opportunities within the company allowing
          us to exceed retention targets by 40%, reducing errors, and most importantly improving the customer experience
          at this touch-point.<br><br>

          I‚Äôm looking to grow in a career that contributes to the development, implementation, and maintenance of
          effective and sustainable interventions that improve health outcomes, especially for vulnerable or underserved
          communities. If you happen to have a role that might be a good fit, please let me know on my <a
